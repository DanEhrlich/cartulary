##: Server Setup on Ubuntu 12.04
##:
##:   This install script can be run as-is on a virgin system. If you're installing on an existing box
##:   it'd be better to walk through it first and adjust things
##:
##:   Before starting, download and unzip the git source to the directory you're in.  Then run this
##:   file like "sudo cartulary-master/INSTALL"



##: 1. Install Apache and PHP5
apt-get update
apt-get install -y apache2 php5 php5-cli libapache2-mod-php5 php5-mcrypt php5-curl php5-tidy ccze


##: 2. Install MySql
apt-get install -y mysql-server php5-mysql
#[you should set a root password during this step and write it down]
mysql_secure_installation
#[No, Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes]


##: 3. Build Database
mysql -u root -p < cartulary-master/templates/newdb.sql
mysql -ucartulary -p cartulary < cartulary-master/templates/cartulary.sql


##: 4. Configure PHP
echo  >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
echo '[cartulary]' >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
echo 'cartulary_conf="/opt/cartulary"' >> /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
echo  >> /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
echo '[cartulary]' >> /etc/php5/cli/php.ini
echo 'cartulary_conf="/opt/cartulary"' >> /etc/php5/cli/php.ini


##: 5. Install Cartulary Files
mv cartulary-master /opt/cartulary


##: 6. Configure Apache
cp /opt/cartulary/templates/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/cartulary
ln -s /etc/apache2/sites-available/cartulary /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-cartulary
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart


##: 7. Create Cartulary Config File
echo 'You are going to answer with "cartulary" as the username and the password.'
echo 'Your fully qualified hostname will be how the outside world gets to your site.'
echo 'If you mess up, just go edit /opt/cartulary/conf/cartulary.conf by hand to correct.'
php /opt/cartulary/bin/confcheck.php


##: 8. Install Cartulary Admin User
echo 'This step is going to give you a username and password. Write it down!'
php /opt/cartulary/bin/usercheck.php


##: 9. Install Crontab
php /opt/cartulary/bin/syscheck.php


##: 10. Set permissions
chown www-data /opt/cartulary/logs/*


##: All done!

##: At this point the system is functional.  A couple of very strong recommendations though:
##: - Edit your /opt/cartulary/conf/cartulary.conf and put in your Amazon S3 credentials.
##:   The values are as follows:
##:
##:     s3_sys_bucket - This is the name of a bucket that you create where users that
##:                     don't have an s3 account will be given some space to store their
##:                     static files.
##:
##:     s3_sys_cname -  This is a DNS cname that points to the user bucket.
##:
##:     s3_sys_backup - This is the name of a bucket that you create that will hold backups
##:                     of your mysql database.  This is very important.  Daily backups
##:                     of your database will begin when you fill in this value.  I suggest
##:                     setting up your backup bucket to keep 4 days of backups and then archive
##:                     older backups to glacier.
##:
##: - Set your proper timezone in the "my_time_zone" value.
